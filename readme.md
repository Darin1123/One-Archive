# A archive for some small projects/repositories

### Ecosystem_Simulator
Originally aimed to implement a no-player game similar to Conway's Game of Life. This project is done with my dear cousin, who is pursuing a PHD degree currently. Due to the time limitation, this project is not mature and complete. Also, this is the very project where I use the skills I learnt in practise.

### Github_Clone
A very old repository trying to mimic the github page. Though it is stationary, purly HTML and CSS.

### ProjectEuler
Here I put my solution to some questions on Project Euler. It was fun at the beginning, however, I later realized that a lot of questions are just purely related to math. Thus, I stopped solving more question on this site. Now, I am in LeetCode and I am happy.

### Pyxel_files
This folder contains some pixel drawings in the format of .pyxel.

### Questions
In the second year in university, there is a course named SFWR 2AA4, which was a complete nightmare to me. (I almost failed on this course.) This is the first GUI I greated in my career which helps me review for the exam of 4AA4. Unfortunately, it cost me a lot of time and is not really helpful for the grades.

### ShopList
This is the first Android App I created. Like a lot of toy apps, this is also an App for list item management. Specifically, this is for managing  shopping list.

### XorLinkedList
This is pure tech! As its name implies, this is the implementation of Xor linked list in Clang. The greatest advantage of this kind of linked list is that this data structure saves space. 

## lineEmUp
The first time play with JavaScript. It is done with my friend Sky. This is a small game proposed by Sky.

## tic-tac-toe
The second year was tough for me. However, I did implemented a tic-tac-toe game in C. At that point, I knew nothing about pointers and thus this is purely a manipulation of a 2-D array.
