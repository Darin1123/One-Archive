Advantages of MCV.;1. Simultaneous development;2. High cohesion;3. Low coupling;4. Ease of modification;5. Multiple views for a model
Disadvantages of MCV.;1. Code navigability;2. Multi-Artifact consistency;3. Pronounced learning curve
Classification of Patterns.;1. Creational design patterns;2. Structural design patterns;3. Behavioural design patterns
Creational design pattern.;1. Abstract factory;2. Object pool;3. Prototype;4. Singleton
Structural design pattern.;1. Adapter;2. Bridge;3. prototype;4. Singleton
Behavioural design pattern.;1. Command;2. Iterator;3. Observer;4. State;5. Strategy
