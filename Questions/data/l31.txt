Outline.;1. Rational design process review;2. Types of test;3. Fault testing
Dynamic test: analysis.;1. Requires the program to be executed;2. Test cases are run and results are checked against expected behaviour;3. Exhaustive testing is the only dynamic technique that guarantees program validity;4. Exhaustive testing is usually impractical or impossible;5. Reduce number of test cases by finding criteria for choosing representative test cases
Static test: analysis.;1. Does not involve program execution;2. Testing techniques simulate the dynamic environment;3. Include syntax checking;4. Generally static testing is used in the requirements and design stage, where there is no code to execute;5. Document and code walkthroughs;6. Document and code inspections
In Integration Testing, developers integrate their code into a shared repo frequently only once a day. Is this statement True or False?;False, developers integrate their code into a shared repo frequently (multiple times a day)
